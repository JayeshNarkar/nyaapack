# Nya Si CLi Torrent installer

A simple CLI tool to first fetch a list of torrents from nyaasi based on search name then download one then compress it. To then be downloaded on a local device (because in my mind http downloading compressed video faster than torrenting)

### THIS IS INTENDED TO BE INSTALLED ON A VM WITH A HIGHSPEED INTERNET!!! (like azure. Which provides free 100$ to students)

### OTHERWISE THIS IS JUST A BAD ORGANIZING TOOL FOR YOUR LOCALLY INSTALLED ANIME EPSIODES
